1. For C-terminal tagging of the POI, identify the genomic DNA
sequence around the STOP codon using ENSMBL (www.
ensembl.org/index.html) (see Note 3).
2. Design specific primers to amplify approximately 500 bp
upstream and downstream of the STOP codon (Fig. 1(1)).
3. Isolate genomic DNA from cultured HCT116 TET-ON/
CMV cell line.
4. Amplify the sequence of interest using a standard PCR proto-
col. Verify the PCR product size with standard agarose gel
electrophoresis.
5. Clone the PCR product into a pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Pro-
mega, Cat# A1360) and subsequently Sanger sequence to
confirm the genomic DNA sequence (Fig. 1(1)). This step is
essential due to allelic polymorphisms that can affect the target-
ing efficiency. Screen the region around the STOP codon for
suitable guide RNA binding sequences using the CRISPOR
website (http://crispor.tefor.net) (see Note 4) (Fig. 1(4)).
6. Introduce silent mutations within the chosen protospacer adja-
cent motif (PAM) sequences to prevent future Cas9 re-cutting
at the same location once the genome was edited (Fig. 1(2)).
To generate the recipient plasmid containing the homology
arm sequence of POI and to insert the AID or APEX2 tag,
change the STOP codon to a BamHI restriction enzyme digest
sequence (Fig. 1(2)). Synthesize the modified PCR product in
a plasmid vector of choice (see Note 5).
7. To insert the AID or APEX2 tag into the plasmid with the
synthesised PCR product (recipient plasmid), digest the plas-
mids using 10 units of BamHI (see Note 6) (Fig. 1(3)). Incu-
bate digest for 1 h at 37 °C.
8. Add 1 unit of CIP directly to the digestion mix of the recipient
plasmid to prevent plasmid self-ligation. Incubate for 1 h at
37 °C. Verify the digestion with standard agarose gel electro-
phoresis. Isolate and purify the desired bands from the agarose
gel using a standard gel purification kit.
9. Ligate the AID or APEX2 tag plasmid fragments into the line-
arised recipient plasmid using 400 units of T4 ligase overnight
at 16 °C (see Note 7) (Fig. 1(3)).
10. Verify the successful generation of CRISPR gene editing donor
plasmids by Sanger sequencing.
3.2 Generation of the
guideRNA
1. Synthesize the guideRNA sequences (sense and antisense) best
suited to the last exon of your POI with BbsI overhangs (Fig. 1
(4)).
2. To insert the guideRNA sequence into the plasmid carrying the
Cas9 gene, digest the plasmid pX330-U6-Chimeric-BB-CBh-
